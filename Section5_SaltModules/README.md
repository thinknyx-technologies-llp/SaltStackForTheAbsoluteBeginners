# Salt MODULES OVERVIEW
#######################

Salt Modules are small, self-contained pieces of code majorly written in Python that can be used to execute tasks on the minions. 

Salt Modules are the fundamental building blocks in Salt Architecture.  All the operations on "Minions‚Äù are performed with the help of Salt Modules. Salt ships with multiple categories of in-built Modules, such as Execution Modules, State Modules, Grains Modules, Pillar Modules and many other, which can be used to automate almost any IT operations and tasks.
